# Washing-Machine-Controller
#### The repository has my design and my implementation for a washing machine controller. The operation of the machine consists of the following states:
- Idle
- Filling water
- Washing
- Rinsing
- Spinning
<br/>
#### The input clock can have 1 of 4 frequencies, encoded ny the clk_freq[1:0] input port. The frequnecies are:
<br/>
1. 1MHz
<br/>
2. 2MHz
<br/>
3. 4MHz
<br/>
